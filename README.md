# Perlin noise experiment

Heavily inspired by this [https://codepen.io/ImagineProgramming/full/LpOJzM](pen) called "Particle Swarm"

As a bonus here are some truly outstanding free resources I used to learn more about perlin noise: [http://staffwww.itn.liu.se/~stegu/simplexnoise/simplexnoise.pdf]("Simplex noise demystified") and [https://www.scratchapixel.com/]("scratchapixel")
